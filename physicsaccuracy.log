Measuring:
1.  enable debug mode
2.  press G
3.  go to the level scene
4.  press F3
5.  hold Q while jumping over the triple
6.  press P until x = 484 (later changed to 482.9 because that's better)
7.  if you want to test at 60TPS: press F
8.  hold SPACE
9.  hold Q
10. (optional) count the amount of blocks you jump on (excluding the one you die to)
11. let go of Q when you die and make note of the x coordinate


With snapback:
240TPS: died after 43 blocks (x = 5755)
60TPS:  died after 34 blocks (x = 4680)

Without snapback:
240TPS: died after 13 blocks (x = 2155)
60TPS:  died after 13 blocks (x = 2156)

With 60TPS snapback:
240TPS: died after 32 blocks (x = 4436)
60TPS:  died after 35 blocks (x = 4675)

With 60TPS snapback and 60TPS jump:
240TPS: DNF
60TPS:  died after 34 blocks (x = 4675)

With 60TPS snapback and may only jump if not going to snap back (jump at end of update loop):
240TPS: died after 41 blocks (x = 5516)
60TPS:  died after 43 blocks (x = 5755)

With 60TPS snapback and may only jump if not going to snap back (jump at beginning of update loop):
240TPS: died after 32 blocks (x = 4436)
60TPS:  died after 34 blocks (x = 4680)

With 60TPS snapback that actually works:
240TPS: died after 25 blocks (x = 3596)
60TPS:  died after 34 blocks (x = 4680)

From now on, replace the x position in step 6 with 482.9, because that's an x position achievable at 60TPS, and it yields more accurate results.

240TPS: died after 35 blocks (x = 4795)
60TPS:  died after 31 blocks (x = 4315)
240TPS: died after 35 blocks (x = 4795)
60TPS:  died after 31 blocks (x = 4315)

With 60TPS snapback that actually works with velocity reset also at 60TPS:
240TPS: died after 35 blocks (x = 4795)
60TPS:  died after 31 blocks (x = 4315)

With 60TPS snapback that actually works with setting grounded only sometimes:
240TPS: died after 32 blocks (x = 4436)
60TPS:  died after 31 blocks (x = 4315)

Again:
240TPS: died after 32 blocks (x = 4436)
60TPS:  died after 31 blocks (x = 4315)

And again:
240TPS: died after 32 blocks (x = 4436)
60TPS:  died after 31 blocks (x = 4315)

Good enough
