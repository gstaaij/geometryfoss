# TODO

- [x] Implement stuff from [GDAPI](https://github.com/Rekkonnect/GDAPI/tree/master/GDAPI/GDAPI/Information/GeometryDash)
  - [x] [Speeds](https://github.com/Rekkonnect/GDAPI/blob/master/GDAPI/GDAPI/Information/GeometryDash/Speeds.cs)
- [x] Migrate to `TraceLog` for logging (instead of `nob_log`)
- [x] Redo all the easing functions
- [ ] Make the easing functions like the ones in GD (ease, elastic, bounce, exponential, sine, back. Ease and elastic have an easing rate)
- [ ] Add jump pads, jump rings, and portals
- [x] If the deltaTime is too high, don't update (will cause phasing through walls if not)

## QoL stuff

- [ ] Add little previews for the easing functions in the UI
