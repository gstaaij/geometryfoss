# TODO

- [x] Implement stuff from [GDAPI](https://github.com/Rekkonnect/GDAPI/tree/master/GDAPI/GDAPI/Information/GeometryDash)
  - [x] [Speeds](https://github.com/Rekkonnect/GDAPI/blob/master/GDAPI/GDAPI/Information/GeometryDash/Speeds.cs)
- [ ] Migrate to `TraceLog` for logging (instead of `nob_log`)
- [ ] Redo all the easing functions
- [ ] Add jump pads, jump rings, and portals
- [ ] If the deltaTime is too high, don't update (will cause phasing through walls if not)
