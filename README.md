# Geometry FOSS

This is an Open Source clone of Geomety Dash written in C.

## Disclaimer

Geometry Dash is made by RobTop Games.
I'm going to use the original assets, but in a way that is respectful (I hope). Please refer to [the plan](THEPLAN.md) for information on how I'm going to do that.

If RobTop wants me to change something, I am of course happy to do that, although it would be very sad if I had to stop this project entirely.

With that said, there is a project on Github that also aims to be a clone of Geometry Dash, but written in GameMaker, and it doesn't look like they try not to steal any assets. Their project hasn't been taken down, so I hope it won't happen to this project.
