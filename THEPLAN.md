# The Plan

## Goals

First, we need to know what we actually want to achieve.
Here are some essential things we need to do:

- [ ] Dynamically calculate the size of a block based on the window size
- [ ] Figure out how to make the objects
- [ ] Implement some physics
- [ ] Make the physics (almost) one to one compatible with Geometry Dash
- [ ] Achieve feature parity with GD 1.0
- [ ] Add some extra features
  - [ ] Built in hacks (maybe MegaHack-like?)
  - [ ] Inability to complete or make progress on levels when hacks have been activated
- [ ] Achieve feature parity with GD 1.1, 1.2, etc.

I will now provide some more details for some of the goals listed above.

### Dynamically calculate the size of a block

> TODO

### Figure out how to make the objects

> BIG TODO

### Implement some physics and try to make them compatible with GD

> MORE BIG TODO





<!-- This is for later maybe
## How are we going to make the objects?

We first have to think of what values are needed to define an object:

- Type (Solid/Static or Hazard or Decoration/Nonsolid)
- Hitbox (top left x & y, width, height)
- Texture
- Texture Size

And some things that are not neccesary, but are nice to have:

- Groups
- Editor Layer
- Z-Layer
- Z-Index
